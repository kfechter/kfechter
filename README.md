&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently Living in Delhi Township, Ohio. Worked at Intel from 2021 to 2023, when I was laid off. Currently working at Johnson & Johnson MedTech Surgery. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked with PowerShell and TeamCity, and had a brief stint working with AWS. Before transitioning into the DevOps/SRE role, I was formerly a Software Engineer (ASP .NET MVC, C#) at the same company.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to my graduation and full-time employment, I worked in various industries during my co-op and as an intern. Starting with healthcare, I worked at Cincinnati Children's, researching how genetic mutations affect medical treatment. I helped write a genetics analysis system in Perl, as well as [assisting with publishing a paper on the subject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4119178/). I then worked as a research co-op at the company I currently work for. In that position I worked on a Python script to analyze excel sheets of clinical trial data. I interned breifly at Strap LLC, where I worked on writing Go unit tests for a wearble data analytics platform. Then my last job before transitioning to full time was MedaCheck, where I worked on the Python and Android applications for the medication adherence platform. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I mainly write Android applications. One of those applications is currently Available on the Play Store. [Calculendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kennethfechter.calculendar) is an application that allows you to calculate the number of days between two dates. I am currently trying to learn more about iOS development, as well as Rust, Python, and .NET Core. My Android applications are built and deployed utilizing a CI/CD pipeline of DroneCI with FastLane. This pipeline builds, tests, and then publishes the application to the corresponding ring of the Play Store.
